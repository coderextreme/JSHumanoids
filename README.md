# JSHumanoids
Scale out Humanoids and Reorient OrientationInterpolators

You will need js.exe from GraalVM (formerly Nashorn) https://github.com/oracle/graaljs/releases/tag/graal-23.1.2 I like the  graaljs-community-jvm-23.1.2 version, a recent Java Developer's Kit (OpenJDK) https://jdk.java.net/21/ and node.js https://nodejs.org/ .  I wil get links.
You will need a bash shell like Git for Windows.
Set up your environment in build.sh and shell/classpath.
To build, try

```bash
bash build.sh
